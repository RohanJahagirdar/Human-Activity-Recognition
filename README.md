# Human-Activity-Recognition
Human Activity Recognition(HAR): 

As a Research Assistant working with the MHealthGroup team at the PHI Department of Northeastern University I was introduced to Human Activity and Accelerometer Data.  My experience there got me interested in this field of Wearable Data Analysis, so I decided to learn more about it. I would like to learn how Human Activity Recognition works and how Accelerometer data is analysed to predict relevent Activity.  My inspiration for this project is this amazing medium post about the research in HAR. It really is an amazing research and has a lot of things which my work takes inspiration from. I would definetly recommend reading it.  

The Medium post is : https://medium.com/@curiousily/human-activity-recognition-using-lstms-on-android-tensorflow-for-hackers-part-vi-492da5adef64  
The research is at: http://curiousily.com/data-science/2017/06/03/tensorflow-for-hackers-part-6.html  

The accompanying source code for the research is on GitHub: https://github.com/curiousily/TensorFlow-on-Android-for-Human-Activity-Recognition-with-LSTMs  

All my work will take heavy inspiration from the above research as I am learning as I continue working on this project and will use the project to learn from and to get a direction.
